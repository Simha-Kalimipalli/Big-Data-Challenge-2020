# Big-Data-Challenge-2020
We were Finalists (among 118 teams from 84 Canadian high schools) in the High School Big Data Challenge 2020. 
In the project, We developed a predictive model for estimation of frequency and intensity of hurricanes based on ocean heat content that was published in STEM Fellowship Journal. The Name of the Paper is "Investigating Effects of Climate Change on Atlantic Ocean Hurricanes". The project involved multiple tasks, including selecting our dataset, the data analysis,  writing a paper and presenting it at Big Data Day. Some of the technologies used are Python, Excel and the Atlantic Hurricane database (HURDAT2)
